## One-Sentence Summary

We first validated the sex bias of the G2/M checkpoint pathway in ESCC. G2/M targets may be included in combination therapy for male patients to improve the efficacy of ESCC treatment.


## Abstract

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is strongly characterized by a male predominance with higher mortality rates and worse responses to treatment in males versus females. Despite the role of sex hormones, other causes that may contribute to sex bias in ESCC remain largely unknown, especially as people age and the hormone difference begins to diminish between sexes. In this study, we analyzed multiomics data from 663 ESCC patients and found that G2/M checkpoint pathway-related sex bias and age bias were significantly present in genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics. In accordance with gene expression patterns across sexes, ten compounds were identified by applying drug repurposing from three drug sensitive databases: The Connective Map (CMap), Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), and The Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal (CTRP). MK1775 and decitabine showed better efficacy in two male ESCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. The drugs' relevance to the transition between G2 and M was especially evident in male cell lines.
